# The Story

Here will be presented the story of the game [Coloring World]

## Idea 1:
The main character is in a dream, and in this strange world, he has to escape.
A time machine allows him to change the time period, in order to come back from the past to the present.
Each period reprents a map, so enemies, backgrounds can adapt to their environment.
He has “tools” to help him escape from the levels in order to reach the time machine.
Each tool can be chosen before starting the level. (it remplaces the multiple character with multiple caracteristic).
So the color changer, the gravity reverser, the jumper, ...
Exits of the level : Time machine

## Year 2 (printf(rand()%500));
humanity has grown too fast and there is no more good space to live on Earth. The idea is to find a new planet where 
humans will be able to survive. You are a scientist, part of an intergalactic expedition. You are charged to explore 
planets, find energy sources and esteem if planets are good or not. Each time, you will be launched on a planet, alone 
(because your mates are useless) and, with your weapon useful to gather energy on a point, you will be able to explore 
the planet.
Exits of the planet :

## What we are agree about :
The main character is a scientist and has a tool that can “create” color platforms on which he can jump and walk.
